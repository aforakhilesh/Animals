Acris gryllus,Southern Cricket Frog,"[""This small frog can be found in several colors. Generally they range from black, brown, or reddish brown to bright green or gray. Along with these patterns of coloration is a stripe of contrasting color beginning anteriorly at the top of the snout and running along the back towards the posterior and ends at the urostyle. Between the eyes of A. gryllus, there is a triangle marking with two corners at each respective eye and the third corner connected to the stripe seen on the back. When compared to a similar species, the northen cricket frog, A. gryllus is found to be smaller and more slender. The snout is markedly more pointed, the legs are longer and more proportional to the size of the body, and there is less webbing between the toes. The first toe is partially free of webbing and 3 joints of the fourth toe are completely free. Warts appear on the skin, especially around the anal area, but are not as prominent as seen in the northern cricket frog. In addition to the stripe running down the back of A. gryllus, there is also a darker longitudinal stripe that can be seen on the rear of the thigh. There is slight sexual dimorphism seen with the southern cricket frogs. The females are generally the slightly larger sex with a length of 16-33 mm and the males achieve a length of 15-29 mm. The males have darker throats, whereas the females' throats are white. Males also have a single subgular sac. When young, the frogs are entirely aquatic tadpoles.

Ambystoma talpoideum,Mole Salamander,"['Mole salamanders are facultatively paedomorphic; they can either become terrestrial adults (metamorphic adults) or retain their aquatic larval form even as they become sexually mature (paedomorphic, branchiate, or neotenic adults). Paedomorphic adults can eventually undergo metamorphosis or they may remain in the aquatic form throughout life. Terrestrial adults live in areas surrounding breeding ponds while paedomorphic adults remain in permanent ponds. Environmental conditions present during larval development can determine which life form an individual salamander will become. Both mole salamander morphs have short, stout bodies with broad, disproportionally large heads. Body size of terrestrial and aquatic males varies across populations and time. In some years and ponds, aquatic males will be larger, on average, than terrestrial males. In other years, the opposite can be true. Body size also varies within the same year, because smaller terrestrial adults have been known to arrive at a pond before larger adults. Neotenic adults have distinctive yellow ventral stripes that makes identification of this species more accurate. They also have light and dark stripes on their their bellies, that is present even in the larval form. Terrestrial adults can have variable body color, ranging from gray to black sometimes with clusters of small bluish-white flecks that are concentrated on the tail and back. Another distinguishing feature of the mole salamander is that there is often a white edge running along the top of the tail. For a period of time after the metamorphosis to a terrestrial creature, these salamanders will still display the remnants of the yellow ventral stripes that are so prominent in the neotonic life cycle.

American toads have four toes on each front leg and five toes connected together by a webbing on each hind leg. The pupils of American toads are oval and black with a circle of gold around them. The sexes can be distinguished in two ways. Males have dark colored throats, of black or brown, while females have white throats and are lighter overall. Also, female American toads are larger than male American toads. American toads are between 50 and 100 mm in length but are usually around 75 mm. American toads can be distinguished from other species of toads by the presence of several dark spots on their backs which contain only one or two warts each.

Ascaphus truei,Coastal Tailed Frog,"['Since tailed frogs spend their life in association with fast-flowing streams, they have evolved some morphological adaptations that stand out from other frogs and toads. For example, the lungs are greatly reduced, presumably to control buoyancy, and the toe tips are hard and keratinized, to facilitate crawling among rocks on the stream bottom. (Adams and Pearl, 2005; Leonard, et al., 1993; Metter, 1964; Stebbins, 2003)', 'Juveniles and adults are small, typically ranging from 2.2 to 5.1 cm in snout-vent length. Overall, color is usually comparable to the tailed frog’s substrate and may vary from tan to chocolate brown or olive green. Regardless of the color, its skin has a characteristic rough feel. Moreover, the head is comparatively large and flattened with a light triangular-shaped mark generally present between the snout and eyes. The eyes themselves have visibly vertical pupils, and a dark stripe extends from the snout to the shoulder. Some more obvious adaptations to its streamside habitat include a slight webbing of the toes, with the outer hind toes also flattened. In addition, they lack tympani or ear membranes and, as a result, lacks the capacity to communicate acoustically, a likely adaptation to the steady sound of flowing water. Tailed frogs get their common name from another aquatic adaptation: males have a short, tail-like copulatory organ used during internal fertilization. Tailed frogs exhibit additional sexual dimorphism in that males are smaller than females, and they develop black, horny pads on the insides of their thighs during the mating season to aid gripping females during amplexus. (Adams and Pearl, 2005; Leonard, et al., 1993; Metter, 1964; Stebbins, 2003)', 'Tadpoles average little more than 11 mm after hatching, but may grow to 65 mm in length before metamorphosis. Initially, hatchlings have no color, but are instead identified according to the presence of a prominent yolk sac seen in the abdomen. However, tadpoles eventually take on a black to brownish-grey coloration of the body that is covered with black speckling. A white dot discernible on the tip of the tail and an obvious copper-colored bar between the eyes and snout are additional field marks for identification. Tailed frog tadpoles also have some adaptations to keep from being swept away by stream currents. The body is flattened ventrally and the tail is laterally compressed. Moreover, the mouth has evolved into an oral disc that is sucker-like, allowing for attachment to rocks. Eggs are unpigmented and are laid in a gelatinous string beneath a rock in shallow water.

The limbs are relatively long. Average body size of adult females is 43 mm snout-vent length (SVL) and maximum sizes for males and females are 49 and 47 mm SVL, respectively. The average size of adult males is not available, as few have been collected. Sexually active males can be distinguished from females by the presence of cirri, wider heads, mental glands, and enlarged premaxillary teeth. Males posses simple testes. Larvae are olive green to brown on the dorsum, cream colored on the venter, and possess a narrow dark line beginning on the snout and extending posteriorly through the center of the eye which terminates in two concentrated patches of melanophores on the cheeks. When viewed laterally, larvae have a mottled appearance with melanophore concentrations increasing towards the tail. Mass of members of the E. bislineata complex has not been reported. No specific information on metabolic rates is available for members of the E. bislineata complex.

The organism is small and is known for its fairly small head, reduced eyes (with a golden iris and black mottling), shovel-nosed snout, slender body and elongate limbs. E. sosorum has a very distinctive dorsal coloration known as the ""salt and pepper"" effect. Dorsal color varies in life from dark through medium gray to purplish gray or gray-brown to yellowish brown to yellowish cream. The varied degrees of blotched and mottled specks are attributed to an irregular mixture of (or lack of) melanophores, iridophores and pigment gaps. Overall, the mottled pattern gives the salamander olive brown specks with a base color of yellowish cream. The presence of silvery-white iridophores enhances the salamanders\' luster. Some salamanders appear pale due to the lack of melanophores. The trunk of E. sosorum is finely speckled with melanophores while the ventral surface is creamy to translucent in color. Sometimes the stomach contents, as well as the presence of eggs in females, can be seen through the translucent skin. Dorsally, the limbs of E. sosorum, are unevenly speckled as well as the toes. Ventrally, the limbs are not speckled. In addition the relatively short tail of E. sosorum has an uneven distribution of melanophores. On the ventral surface of the tail the salamander has a narrow, orange-yellow strip from the posterior margin of cloacal vent to the tip. Furthermore, unique traits of barton spring salamanders include: three pairs of brightly-colored, red gills, four fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot and 16 pre-sacral vertebrae.

An average female specimen is about four inches in length, whereas their male counterparts are more likely to be in the 3 inch range (Mattison 1987). These frogs tend to be light bluish green to emerald green dorsally, with scattered white or gold spots on the side and occasionally on the back from the angle of the mouth to the base of the forearms. As with many treefrogs, this species is capable of some color change. The ventral surface is a milky white and rough in texture. The dorsum and throat are smoother to the touch. Vomerine teeth are prominant between and behind the choanea. These treefrogs have enormous toe pads. Fingers are partially webbed, but the toes are almost completely webbed. There is a distinct tympanum present. The second finger tends to be longer than that of the first (Cogger 1983). The eye has a horizontal pupil whereas other hylids tend to have a vertical pupil.

Aquatic females can sometimes be confused with breeding males, because they have lighter, smoother skin, tail crests, and larger vents than do terrestrial females. However, these features are less pronounced than in breeding males.

There is light coloring around their yellow eyes and on their snout that is different from other Taricha species. They also have warty skin, which contains tarichatoxin (tetrodotoxin). The best distinguishing characteristic of Sierra newts is the Y-shaped vomerine teeth pattern on their upper jaw, which is different than the V-shaped pattern in other newts. During the breeding season, the skin of the male becomes smooth and lighter in color, the tail develops a blade, nuptial pads develop on their toes for grasping the female, and their vents enlarge. The skin of females during the breeding season becomes more vascular, their tail may develop a small blade, and their vents become more prominent. Sierra newt larvae are aquatic and can get up to 13 to 14 mm. They are yellow on their dorsal side, with two broad black bands on their back. Older larvae have dark spots that look like blotches on their bodies.

Telmatobius culeus,NaN,"['Lake Titicaca water frogs are easily recognized due to the permanent, loose, fibrous, and glandular skin folds hanging from the sides, dorsum, and hind legs. These folds give the frog a “baggy” appearance. However, dermal folds are important for cutaneous gas exchange because they increase the surface area through which gases can be exchanged. In fact, these folds are so well adapted for cutaneous gas exchange that it is not necessary for the frogs to ventilate their lungs at all. Because these dermal folds essentially act as “gills,” the lungs of the frog are one-third the size of any frog in the family Ranidae, flattened, poorly vascularized, and contain only primary alveoli. Body coloration is highly variable among individuals, but these frogs are always some combination of olive green, dark green, or even black dorsally and either white or pearl-colored ventrally. Their body consists of a large flattened head with a rounded snout and highly vascularized buccal cavity, relatively narrow caudal end, and richly vascularized skin. Lake Titicaca water frogs have long hind legs with webbed digits only on the hind feet. These frogs are relatively large and are the largest fully-aquatic frogs, reaching snout-vent lengths up to 14 cm. Due to their large size and dermal folds, Lake Titicaca water frogs often weigh over 250 g. In comparison to other anurans, they have thinner skin, which makes gas exchange easier. Telmatobius culeus has less emarginated toe webbing, paler white ventral coloration, and adults of smaller size in comparison to individuals of T. culeus. (Benavides, et al., 2002; Feder and Burgren, 1985; Hutchison, et al., 1976; Lee, 2010; Ruiz, et al., 1983)', 'Animals that dive to great depths have to overcome problems regarding gas compression and exchange in the body. Titicaca water frogs are well-adapted for existence in water at high elevations where the maximum partial pressure of Oxygen is 100 mm Hg. Their specialized skin functions like a gill that secures enough oxygen to meet metabolic demands, which is the lowest recorded metabolic demand of all anurans. Cutaneous gas exchange is extremely efficient, but if it becomes impossible in a hypoxic environment, pulmonary respiration can maintain the metabolic rate for several hours. Even though they do not rely on pulmonary respiration, air is always found in the lungs of dissected frogs. Though their hematocrit percentage and hemoglobin concentration are within average range, the Lake Titicaca water frog has the smallest erythrocyte volume among all amphibians and the greatest erythrocyte counts among all amphibians aside from tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum). However, these characteristics are subject to environmental influence. During a 10-week acclimation period at 335 m elevation (compared to 3,800 m), the erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit count all steadily declined. Their critical oxygen tension is low compared to other aquatic amphibians, so Titicaca water frogs are highly effective at removing oxygen from the water. The oxygen dissociation curve for whole blood of Lake Titicaca water frogs is sigmoidal. This can be explained by circulatory changes consisting of a separation of oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted blood through the heart allowing the frog to distribute the blood to areas that will increase gas exchange efficiency. The network of cutaneous arteries and veins is much more elaborate and larger than most other frogs. Their red blood cell (RBC) count is high for anurans, and is only exceeded by males of Hyla hallowelli and Rana tsushimensis during the breeding season. The pH of ventricular blood averages around 7.5, remaining fairly neutral at all times. The “waving” behavioral adaptation allows for increased ventilation across the skin or, in hypoxic conditions, allows for pulmonary gas exchange. No other amphibian is known to possess this combination of adaptations for aquatic life at high altitudes.
